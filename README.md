# 1.28" Circular display prototyping board

This is a small prototyping PCB designed for the East Rising ER-TFT1.28-2 240x240 TFT display module with 24 pin connector.

The small connector is too small to hand solder, so this must be reflowed, but as there is only one part on the PCB a heatgun or iron could be used for this.

All the pins have been broken out to separate header pins, so that the same board can be used for other displays using the same connector, in case the pinouts are different!

I've included all the tech docs I have here too.
